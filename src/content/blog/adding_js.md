And finally, what you've all been waiting for, Javascript.

### Javascript

Javascript.

The part of webdev everyone wants to start with, Javascript is how you'll make those cool interactive web elements, run games in the browser, and even hack people! Despite being named after Java, it is quite different, and the history behind that is interesting. You can read more [here](https://medium.com/@salimian/the-story-behind-the-name-javascript-15e879c42760).

This time, we used Javascript and the [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) API to add a light/dark theme toggler to our website. I chose to use a darker grey for the dark theme as I felt that pure black was a little to harsh.

We did go further, using javascript to help validate forms. In this case, javascript will read all your inputs and display information (such as minimum characters) and errors (such as illegal characters) live as you're typing! It also uses the [Constraint Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation#the_constraint_validation_api) API to display custom messages when there is an error, and also logs all of those errors for future reference. You can view this form in form-with-js.html.

[Here](https://github.com/Eugene-Myong/CSE-134B-HMWK-4) is the github repo for the site with javascript added.
