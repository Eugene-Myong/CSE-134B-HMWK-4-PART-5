Now that we have our baseline, it's time to make it look good. And we do that by using CSS.

### Cascading Style Sheets

Arguably the hardest of the Web Dev Trifecta, CSS is what you'll use to make your page look pretty. It can do everything from add background colors to change how the page look on different screen sizes. But all this capability isn't free you know, as the professor said, everything is a tradeoff. 

What's the downside of CSS you ask? Well, just try to use it. It appears very simple at first, but when you have lots of rules and selectors all over the place, it gets quite difficult to keep track of. Especially when dealing with multiple pages, added frameworks, and everything else the web has to offer, it becomes very easy to blame it all on CSS. But that's not necessarily the case is it?

With all of these complications comes the ability to truly showcase mastery. The more complicated the CSS and its components are, the more impressive it is when somone really uses good CSS and web dev habits to create something that looks good, acts good, and is easy to understand and change/improve.

I may not be on that level (not even close) but hopefully I learned a little bit about it, and I can say for sure that you'll definitely see some changes from the last version.
