All sites have to begin somewhere. For us, it was only using HTML. This is because we are following the "Progressive Enhancement Model".

### What is the Progressive Enchancement Model?

Progressive Enhancement is a form of development where we add technologies one at a time, starting from the bottom. In this case, that's HTML. In later development versions, we add CSS and Javascript, but for now we stick to mastering the basics to make our live easier in the future.

Why would you use this model, I hear you ask? Well, the benefits of progressive enhancement include 
- Resilience: If a higher level technology fails, the lower level ones are still functional and the site can still run.
- Performence: Working from the bottom up makes it easier to optimize and prevent wasteful/bad code, which will help prevent us pulling our hair out trying to retrace all our steps when something isn't as good as it should be in the future.
- a11y friendliness: By laying out and formatting our page from the bare bones, we can easily make our page accessible web-reader friendly, ensuring that everyone can acccess our page easily.
- Future-planning: Establishing a good skeleton means that when we go to add some meat to these bones, it becomes much easier and structured then if we were to try and build the content around the look.

By following this format we established how we wanted our site to look and got the basics up and running. This also gave us experience with html, something that would be very handy in the future when we work with a certain language who seeks to manipulate html.
